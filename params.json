{"name":"Qtz","tagline":"Qt-based Rapid Application Development Framework ","body":"# Qtz Framework [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/soroush/qtz.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/soroush/qtz)\r\n\r\nQtz is a Qt-based Rapid Application Development Framework. Currently Qtz\r\nconsists of following libraries:\r\n\r\n* QtzCore\r\n  - Authentication \r\n  - Access Control Lists\r\n  - User Management System\r\n  - Settings Backend\r\n* QtzData\r\n  - Database Integration Backend (multiple vendors)\r\n  - Data Management Utilities (cross-vendor backup, restore, encrypt tools)\r\n  - Data Analysis Tools\r\n* QtzWidgets\r\n  - Advanced Editor Widgets\r\n  - Data Management GUI\r\n  - Security GUI Backend\r\n  - Miscellaneous \r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nThis library depends on Qt4 or Qt5 and Crypto++. You also need a modern C++\r\ncompiler that implements C++11 specification. Currently GCC >= 4.6 and Clang are\r\nsupported. There is no guarantee to successful builds of Microsoft Visual C++\r\ncompilers, and there is no plan to support them in the future.\r\n\r\n## Compile\r\nTo compile Qtz on *nix like environments type:\r\n\r\n    qmake CONFIG+=release CONFIG+=local\r\n    make\r\n\r\nIn Windows environment:\r\n\r\n    mingw32-make\r\n\r\nTo speed up build process you may want to use `make -j<N>` where `<N>` is number\r\nof your processors.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nIf build has been finished successfully, you may want to install it:\r\n\r\n    sudo make install\r\n\r\nOn Linux platforms all files will go through correct path. On Windows you may\r\nneed to define explicit paths.\r\n\r\n    sudo mingw32-make install INSTALL_ROOT=c:\\mingw64","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
